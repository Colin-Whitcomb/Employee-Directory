## Summary & Process
For this assignment, our objective was to create an employee directory app that can perform basic sorting functions. Using these functions, we can sort the employees by first or last name, from A-Z or Z-A.

I began this assignment by establishing a static page and populated it with the data of the 12 employees which were "seeded" in a local json file. I then set the format and styling of the page. After that, I implemented the functionality of the sorting.

## Takeaways

Function Syntax is <i>very</i> important. For quite some time I was wrestling with a function that was causing an endless loop becaue the ES6 arrow syntax was not written properly. Big thank you to [Bobbi Tarkany](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobbi-tarkany/) for helping me out with this one!
