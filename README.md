## Summary & Process
For this assignment, our objective was to create an employee directory app that can perform basic sorting functions. Using these functions, we can sort the employees by first or last name, from A-Z or Z-A.

I began this assignment by establishing a static page and populated it with the data of the 12 employees which were "seeded" in a local json file. I then set the format and styling of the page. After that, I implemented the functionality of the sorting.
